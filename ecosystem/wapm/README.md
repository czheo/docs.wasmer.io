# WAPM

[WAPM](https://wapm.io/) is a package manager for WebAssembly modules to be used standalone by any WebAssembly Runtime (such as the Wasmer Runtime).

The WAPM ecosystem makes WebAssembly more accessible to developers. The system is enabled by a couple tools:

* WAPM package registry for storing and serving packages [wapm.io](https://wapm.io/)
* WAPM package client (called `wapm` CLI) for installing and managing packages. See the [wapm-cli Github Repo](https://github.com/wasmerio/wapm-cli)

The `wapm` tool comes bundled with [Wasmer: the WebAssembly runtime](https://wasmer.io/), but it works great with the other [server-side runtimes](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm#non-web-embeddings) and the web!
